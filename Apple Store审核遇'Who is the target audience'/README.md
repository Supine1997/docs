Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed


We have started the review of your app, but we are not able to continue because we need additional information about your app.

Next Steps

To help us proceed with the review of your app, please review the following questions and provide as much detailed information as you can.

- Who is the target audience?
- How do users obtain an account?
- Is this app meant for internal distribution in your own company, in the company of one target client, or in multiple target clients’ companies?
- In which countries will this app primarily be distributed?
- If this app is meant for internal distribution, will the app be accessible by both internal and external partners? Or will it be exclusive to in-house employees?

Once you reply to this message in Resolution Center with the requested information, we can proceed with your review.



Since your App Store Connect status is Metadata Rejected, we do NOT require a new binary. To revise the metadata, visit App Store Connect to select your app and revise the desired metadata values. Once you’ve completed all changes, reply to this message in Resolution Center and we will continue the review.
